* Overview
Elixir is dope. Some handy cheatsheets go here.

* Syntax
** KW List as last parameter
If the last parameter of a function is a KW list, you don't actually need to
delimit or anything, really.

#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
Repo.get_by(Query, team: team, slug: slug) == Repo.get_by(Query, [team: team, slug: slug])
#+END_SRC

This only works in the last list of a parameter list. This is also how the =def
thing, do: <function body>= syntax works.
