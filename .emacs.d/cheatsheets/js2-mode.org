Ah, javascript. Myeh.


* D3
D3, the ultra-versatile, and very hard to use library for datavis.
** SVG
*** Elements
- =g=: A group. Basically a =div= from what I can see.
- =rect=: A square.
*** Basic Concepts
**** Coordinate system
The coordinate system is a bit different than you might be used to:

- 0,0 is in the top left, meaning x grows as usual, and y is "upside down"
- There are no negative coordinates
- "height" is y + height, meaning "downward growth"
- "width" is x + width, meaning "rightward growth"
*** Attributes
**** Transform
This is the swiss-army-knife to position, rotate, everything.
The list of transformation:

- =translate(x, y)=: This is your positioning army-knife. Move it from its old
  position to =x,y=. If no explicit positin is already given, you're operating
  from the top-left corner, =0,0=.
